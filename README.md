# Burner.kiwi
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/haydenwoodhead/burner.kiwi)

A temporary email service and API built in Go. No JavaScript. No tracking. No analytics. No bullshit.

Check it out here: https://burner.kiwi

## About

Burner.kiwi is designed to be able to run on both AWS Lambda and normal machines. The __goal__ is to have several backing 
database implementations and flexible configuration.

At this point it's working on normal machines and in Lambda. There are now three production-ready database implementations - DynamoDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite3.

This is definitely still a work in progress, see the To Do section.

## Deploy Your Own!

You will need to:
1. Buy at least one domain
2. Sign up for a Mailgun account
3. Add your new domain(s) to your Mailgun account
4. Ensure you can receive email through Mailgun on that domain

### AWS Lambda

Deploy your own straight to AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. 

Deploy to ap-southeast-2 (Sydney):

[![Deploy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/stacks/new?stackName=burnerkiwi&templateURL=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/burner-kiwi-ap-southeast-2/cloudformation.json)

Deploy to us-east-1 (N. Virginia):

[![Deploy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=burnerkiwi&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/burner-kiwi-us-east-1/cloudformation.json)

Deploy to eu-west-1 (Ireland):

[![Deploy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/new?stackName=burnerkiwi&templateURL=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/burner-kiwi-eu-west-1/cloudformation.json)

If you want to deploy to another AWS region you will modify the provided cloudformation.json template and upload your code to a bucket in that region.

### Other

Or run it on your own server. Build a binary, set up with the configuration parameters detailed below and run it.

## Test

Run all of burner.kiwi's tests locally:

```bash
make test
```

## Build

Run:

```bash
make build
```
This will create and populate a `build` directory containing the binary file and minified/renamed static assets.

If you wish to use SQLite3 you must run:

```bash
make build-sqlite
```

## Configuration Parameters

These are all set as environment variables.

Parameter | Type | Description
----------|------|-------------
LAMBDA | Boolean | Whether or not the binary is being hosted on AWS Lambda
KEY | String | Key used to sign cookies and keys. Make this something strong!
WEBSITE_URL | String | The url where the binary is being hosted. This must be internet reachable as it is the destination for Mailgun or Sendgrid routes
STATIC_URL | String | The url where static content is being hosted. Set to `/static` to have the binary serve it. Otherwise set to a full domain name with protocol e.g https://static.example.com
DEVELOPING | Boolean | Set to `true` to disable HSTS and set `Cache-Control` to zero. 
DOMAINS | []String | Comma separated list of domains connected to Mailgun account and able to receive email
MG_KEY | String | Mailgun private API key
MG_DOMAIN | String | One of the domains set up on your Mailgun account
DB_TYPE | String | One of `memory`, `postgres`, `sqlite3` or `dynamo` for InMemory, PostgreSQL, SQLite3 (not this requires building with SQLite3 support) and DynamoDB respectively 
DATABASE_URL | String | URL for the PostgreSQL database or filename for SQLite3 see [documentation here](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#dsn-examples).
DYNAMO_TABLE | String | Name of the dynamodb table to use for storage (if using DynamoDB)
RESTOREREALIP | Boolean | Restores the real remote ip using the `CF-Connecting-IP` header. Set to `true` to enable, `false` by default
BLACKLISTED | []String | Comma seperated list of domains to reject email from

If you are using DynamoDB a non AWS environment you need to set these. If you are on AWS you should, of course, use IAM roles.

Parameter | Type | Description
----------|------|-------------
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | String | Your AWS access key ID corresponding to an IAM role with permission to use DynamoDB
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | String | AWS secret access key corresponding to your access key ID
AWS_REGION | String | The AWS region containing the DynamoDB table. Use the appropriate value from the Region column [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ddb_region).

## Deleting Old Routes

Burner.kiwi creates a new Mailgun route for every inbox and email address. This allows us to delete these routes once the
inbox expires and prevents the server being unnecessarily burdened by webhooks for inboxes that don't exist anymore. 

If you are running outside of AWS Lambda and not using DynamoDB this cleanup is done once every hour automatically.

## Contributing

If you notice any issues or have anything to add, I would be more than happy to work with you. 
Create an issue and outline your plans or bugs.

## To do

* Code refactor/redo/cleanup
* More tests for server package
* Night theme
* Print html errors rather than just plain text
* Better configuration
* Noob friendly setup tutorial

Again, if you think you can help, then create an issue and outline your plans.
